-Controls are given in game
-Goal of the level is to kill all enemies

Weapons:
-4 Weapons: Melee, Rifle, Machine Gun, and Shotgun
-Melee has unlimited ammo and is available in both hands immidiatlly
-It does a significant amount of damage, however you must be right in front of the enemy to hit them
-Rifle is the starting gun and is burst fire, fires 3 rounds per click
-The rifle is powerful but runs out of ammo quickly, espicially if dual wielding
-The Machine gun is very powerful, with a large ammo clip and rapid fire while holding down the mouse button
-The shotgun shoots 5 pellets each shot, but only takes 1 bullet per shot
-The pellets themselves do little damage but hitting an enemy with all of them does a lot of damage
-Shotgun pellets do not travel as far as other bullets however, requiring the player to be closer to the enemy

Enemies:
-3 unique enemy types, Soldiers, Aliens, and Turrets
-Turrets do not move and when the player gets close enough they will shoot at the player
-There is two types of turrets, one is semi-auto and the other is fully automatic
-Aliens do not move at all until the player gets within a certain distance of them, then they move directly toward the player
-If an alien hits you the player takes damage
-There are 3 different aliens, the difference between them is speed, health, and damage
-The slower an alien is the more health and damage it has
-Soldiers move back and forth either vertically or horizantally until the player comes within a certain distance
-3 types of soldiers: light, medium, and heavy
-Light soldiers carry a rifle and have low health
-The enemies rifle is also semi-automatic, however unlike the player it is not burst fire
-Medium soldiers have more health and carry a shotgun, which behaves the same as the players
-Heavy soldiers have the most health and carry a machine gun, which behaves the same as the players

Pickups:
-Killing an enemy Soldier or Turret will drop their gun as a pickup item
-Picking up an enemy weapon restores your ammo for the respective weapon (rifle, machine gun or shotgun)
-As well, picking up an enemy gun increases how many weapons you have
-If you pick up a gun you do not have you will now be able to use it
-If you pick up a gun you do have but only have one of, you will now have two, and be able to dual wield them

Language and Text:
-There is a drop bar in the main menu and pause screen that changes the language of all text (besides the timer)
-This was implemented using my tools 3 assignment
-There isint much of a dialogue tree but all text and which text to display after clicking a button is all pulled from the scriptable objects, which were edited with the custom editors
-Only English, French and Spanish are included in the build of the game
